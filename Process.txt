Exact Process to be followed:-

1]When we initialize git repository at our local machine using 'git init' , we are directed to 'master'branch.    
2]Then we do 'git add .' and 'git commit -m "Initial Commit" to save all the files at our "Local Head".  
3]Now Git doesn't know were to push this repository on GitHub. So we need set a "Remote Head" for it.  
4]We create an empty repository on GitHub "Node-Repo" were our code can be pushed.  
5]We were directed to the page from were we copied the "origin link". (Below mentioned link are also given on the same page.)  
4]Remote Head for our local git repository is set by following 3 commands:-  
  a) git remote add origin "copied origin link"  :-------------------------> We can confirm wether Remote origin is added correctly by git remote -v  
  b) git branch -M main                          :-------------------------> Very intresting thing happened here. When we initialized our git repository,  
                                                                             We were directed to master branch also that was the only branch present. But  
                                                                             after this command 'master' changed to 'main' and now only 'main' is present.  
  c) git push -u origin main                     :-------------------------> This pushes all our code to main branch on GitHub repository. Here also only   
                                                                             'main' branch is present same as our local repository. It also sets main branch  
                                                                             as our upstream so now onwards we can type 'git push' , no need to specify branch.
